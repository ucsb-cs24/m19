6.  (10 pts) Modify the definition of the throttle class on page 35, to create a new throttle ADT, which allows the user of the ADT to specify the number of shift levels when creating objects of that class. You don't need to provide an implementation of the new throttle ADT, just the class definition.

7.  (10 pts) Modify the definition of the throttle ADT on page 35, to create a new throttle ADT, which models a throttle as having a lever to control the flow of fuel (as before), and a light that indicates if the fuel flow is above or below a threshold. The light is green if the fuel flow is below 70%, and red otherwise. The new throttle ADT should have appropriate member functions to check on the status of the light. Implement the new throttle ADT
