    <b> Jinjin Shao(TA)</b>
    <i> "Hi, I am Jinjin. Welcome to CS24! I’m a PhD student in the Computer Science department. I have been TA for both CS16 and CS24 in the past. Thus I have seen many studnets having fun (So will you) in these introductory C++ classes. In this class, besides C++, you will also learn some basic knowledge about data structures and algorithm, which is so important for your success in the future (not only in the school). I am glad to share my programming experience with you and guide you through this class. You can reach out to me anytime when you need help via email or piazza. I am sure we will have a perfect experience in this course" </i>

  <b> Jack Alexander (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hey, my name is Jack, and I’ve been looking forward to TAing this class for the whole year! I’m a master’s student in the Computer Science BS/MS program, where you get a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in five years (highly recommended). In the past, I’ve mentored in CS56 and CS190I, and last quarter I TAed CS184. As I said, I’ve wanted to TA an introductory CS class for quite a while, and I can’t wait to help guide you through the more advanced elements of C++ as well as your first complex data structures. Linked lists and binary search trees had something of a magical quality for me when I first learned them three years ago, and I hope you will have a similarly enthralling experience in this course" </i>

  <b> Angela Yung (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi, I am Angela, and a fourth year CS major here at UCSB. I started mentoring last year and had a lot of fun, so I'm really excited to be a mentor again this quarter! I think data structures is pretty wicked, so CS24 and CS130A have been some of my favorite classes and I hope they can be some of your favorites as well!

Feel free to reach out with any questions, whether they are about labs, classes in general, or internships. I also like puzzles, baking, and going on hikes so I'm always looking for good recommendations." </i>

  <b> Sayali Kakade (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone, I’m so excited to be one of your tutors for this upcoming quarter! I know this class can be daunting at times, and I’d love to help you with any concept that you might be unclear about, figure out how to approach the PAs, or even give you career or college advice (classes to take, internship advice, things unrelated to academics, etc). <br> This class will set the foundation for your classes in the future so it’s very important to understand the material, and even if you need to ask the same question multiple times to really drive a point home, I never want you to feel afraid to ask me anything! If you see me around campus, feel free to say hi or reach out to me on Piazza. Hope you have a great quarter! :)" </i>

  <b>  Carly  Larsson (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Salutations and welcome to CS 24. In the coming weeks we will both be learning something new: I will be tutoring CS 24 for the first time, and you all will be taking CS 24. I hope we can work together, and get as much computer science knowledge into our brains as possible. Currently I’m a third year CCS CS student, also enrolled in the MS/BS program. I’m the Treasurer for the Society of Women Engineers (S.W.E) and would love to recruit some new computer scientists! This coming summer and last summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. If you have questions about computer science, CS 24, internships, or S.W.E. please reach out to me at carly@umail.ucsb.edu. " </i>

  <b> Natasha Lee (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! I’m Natasha, a fourth year Computer Science major here at UCSB. 
I love being a tutor/mentor because it’s something I wish I had when I first started learning computer science. There are so many resources available online but sometimes you just don’t know where to start. Us tutors can help guide you and point you in the right direction!

I’ve been told I look intimidating when I’m not talking, but I promise I’m really nice! Come talk to me about upper div electives, networking as an introvert, watercoloring, and most importantly the best spots to watch the sunset!" </i>

  <i> "Hey all! :) My name is Keith and I'm a 4th year student here and I'm part of the MS/BS program where I'm currently pursuing my Masters! I'm super excited to be able to help you all. I love getting all kinds of questions and can't wait to see what you guys can come up with! Seriously, you can ask me questions about anything and I'll do my best to try to help. If you just want to chat, feel free to approach me whenever and wherever.
A little more about me.. I love software and technology as well as nature and the outdoors. When I'm not on a computer, you can find me surfing or at the beach! " </i>

  <i> "Hi! My name is  Abhishek, I am a 4th year CCS Computing and Biology double major. I am super excited to be one of the mentors for CS24. Here’s a little background about me:  In the last few years I have been lucky enough to have worked with leading scientists at Stanford, UCSF and UCSB to uncover the potential of big data in computational biology. My interests lie in deep learning precision interpretation of medical imaging for the clinics. I have been involved with a number of ongoing projects in skin and breast cancer quantitative image analysis. If any of you also like these topics or just want to chat, don’t hesitate to contact me on Piazza :) " </i>

  <b>  Andrew Gaut (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Andrew Gaut and I’m a first year computer science major. My pronouns are he/him/his. I’m really excited to tutor CS24 this quarter! I’ve always loved tutoring and I’ve loved computer science since I started, so I’m really excited to merge my two interests! I hope to help learn how to construct readable and usable classes from scratch. I also want to help students understand the concepts behind the projects and labs in CS24, because the concepts are very important (and integral to finishing the programming assignments). Outside of school, I love to watch and play basketball. I’m a HUGE Lakers fan, so I’m always ready to talk about this year’s MVP Lonzo Ball or basketball in general. If any of you guys are interested in software or hardware projects outside of class, I’ve got some experience with the club IEEE and I’ve done one of their projects. If you have any questions about IEEE, want to talk basketball, or have any questions about CS24 feel free to talk to me or email me (at ajg@umail.ucsb.edu)!
