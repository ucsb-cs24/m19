Complete your reading of Chapter 3, section 3.1, Chapter 4, 4.1 - 4.5   (If you don't have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<ol markdown="1">
1. (10 pts) What is the output of the following code:

<div markdown="1">
```
int *p, *q;
int x;
p = &x;
q = new int;
*p = 50;
*q = 60;
cout << *p << ", "   << *q << endl;
p = q;
cout << *p << ", "  <<  *q << endl;
*p = 30;
*q = 40;
cout << *p << ", " << *q << endl;
delete p;
```
</div>

2. (5 pts) Suppose that we added the line <code>delete q;</code> after the last line of the code in the previous question, how would the behavior of the program change? 

<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3. (10 pts) On page 98 (Chapter 3), the author talks about value semantics, which specifies different ways of copying the value of objects of a class to other objects of the same class. Using examples write two ways in which this can be done for the Quadratic class covered in lecture. You can find the code for that class here: <a href="https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-s19-mirza/cs24-s19-lectures/blob/master/lec-03/quadratic.cpp">https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-s19-mirza/cs24-s19-lectures/blob/master/lec-03/quadratic.cpp</a>

<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

4. Read the code provided in pointCloud.h in point.h in this repo that describes a point and a pointCloud: <a href="https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-w18/cs24-h03">https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-w18/cs24-h03</a>. Answer the following questions about the provided code


i. (5 pts) Suppose the parametrized constructor was implemented as below, what is the syntax/logic error. Provide a correct implementation.
<div markdown="1">
```
pointCloud::pointCloud(int cap = 10){
	cloud = new point[capacity];
}
```
</div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

ii. (10 pts) Implement the copy constructor 
<div style="margin-bottom:20em"></div>

iii. (20 pts) Implement the copy-assignment operator
<div style="margin-bottom:20em"></div>

iv. (20 pts) Implement the destructor
<div style="margin-bottom:20em"></div>

v. (20 pts) Indicate which constructor/operator of the pointCloud class is called for the given code by writing (a), (b), (c), (d) or "none" against each of the statements as defined here: (a) parameterized constructor, (b) copy constructor, (c) assignment operator, (d) destructor.  

<div markdown="1">
```
void whatsThePoint(){
	pointCloud *p = new pointCloud;
	for (int i = 0;i < 20; i++){
		p->insert(point(i, 10*i));
	}
	pointCloud q(*p);
	pointCloud w;
	w = q;
	delete p;
}
```
</div>
